## 0.1.1 - 2025-04-15

### Added

- Introduced High-Level API: Added wrap/assoc and wrap/dissoc functions using simple keywords (e.g., :get, :assoc) for easier customization of common behaviors.
- Added examples-high-level.md and updated documentation.

### Changed

#### Major Performance Optimizations:

- Implemented specialized internal types (WrapMap+...) to significantly speed up baseline assoc and get operations by reducing runtime dispatch overhead.
- Optimized wrap map constructor, especially when called via apply, bringing performance close to native hash-map.
- Improved transient batch assoc! performance to be nearly on par with native transients.
- Improved persistent! performance, though it remains an area with overhead compared to native maps.
